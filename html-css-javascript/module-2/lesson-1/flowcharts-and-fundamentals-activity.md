**Instructions Part 1:**

Using a pencil and paper or a flowcharting software like [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), design the following programs:

1. A program that takes in a number and outputs double that number.

### Instructions Part 2:

Have you ever logged into a website and the landing page greets you by name? Let's look at designing that functionality.

Using a pencil and paper or a flowcharting software, design the following program:

* A program that takes in a user's name as input and displays the string 'Welcome \[username\]'.

For example, if the user input 'Luciana', the program would display 'Welcome Luciana'.
